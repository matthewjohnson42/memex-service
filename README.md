# Personal Memex Service

A Java application that implements a personal knowledge base, named for the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) described in a 1945 Atlantic article.

The application is planned to be hosted on AWS, and is planned to interact with [personal-memex-ui](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/personal-memex-ui) as its frontend.

The purpose of the application is to store notes with tags so that those notes may be later referenced across months and years.

### Using the service locally
To run the Java application, install Docker desktop, install maven, and run the [docker-compose-up.sh](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/pesonal-memex-service/scripts/docker-compose-up.sh) script.

### Using the hosted service
Coming soon

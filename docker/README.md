# docker build module

A module containing scripts and files that are used to start docker containers for the app, a Mongo instance, and an ElasticSearch instance. These containers comprise the full backend of the personal-memex.

Helper scripts prepare the execution environment for Docker image builds, run the Docker image builds, then use docker-compose to start docker containers from the built Docker images. Root helper script is `docker-compose-up.sh`.

## module contents

In addition to standard Dockerfiles for specifying image build and docker-compose files for specifying container build, this maven module includes the following content:

#### `mongo/*`

A directory containing instructions for starting a configured and initialized mongo container.

The directory content includes:
1) a JavaScript file containing DB init queries
1) a shell script that submits the JavaScript contents

#### `docker-build.sh`

Builds the Docker image of Mongo, runs a maven clean install on the project, and uses the output of the maven clean install to build a Docker image of the app.

#### `docker-compose-up.sh`

Invokes the build script, then uses the `docker-compose` command line utility to start containers.
